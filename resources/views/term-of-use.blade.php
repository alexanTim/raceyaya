                                                the Third Party Sites. The links from the Services do not imply that we

                                                In an ongoing effort to better understand and serve the users of our Services,
                                                we often conduct research on our customer demographics, interests, and
                                                behavior based on Personal Data and other information that we have
                                                collected. This research may be compiled and analyzed on an aggregate
                                                basis. Please note that this aggregate information does not identify you
                                                personally  and we therefore consider and treat this data as Non-Personal Data.
