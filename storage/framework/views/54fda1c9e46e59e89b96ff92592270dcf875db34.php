								<p>RaceYaya has been a valuable partner for Registration and Timing for Pilipinas Akyathlon.</p>
									Being on RaceYaya gives the Akyathlon higher exposure to our target participants. We get the benefit of extending our event to RaceYaya’s growing network. The registration process is smooth and hassle-free for the runners. And any hiccup encountered is swiftly resolved by the RaceYaya Technical Team.</p>
									<p>
									As a Timing Partner, they provide high-tech but affordable solution that works well considering the state of our telco infrastructure. Accurate updates and results are easily accessible and in a timely manner.</p>
									<p>
									The RaceYaya Team has also been very professional in our dealings with them – providing highly satisfactory customer service and earnestly receiving constructive feedback. No wonder, they’ve made huge strides in improvement since we first used their service!</p>
									It’s the one-stop-shop that the trail running community has badly needed. I hope RaceYaya becomes the standard across the local races and beyond.</p>

								<p style="text-align: justify; text-justify:newspaper; ">This is the 2nd year our group partnered with RaceYaya. 2nd for RMR and 1st for the inaugural Salomon Xtrail Iloilo. As an Online Registration Center it raised the bar higher across all platforms I have tried using. I can say that it is a must-use tool for all race directors nowadays who want to migrate from the traditional onsite registration as it is easy to use and set-up, convenient, and efficient.</p>
								<p> They are always open to suggestions and willing to improve their ware to cater all what is needed to be done for a good and efficient online registration center. As a runner, I must say that it is one of the most convenient and efficient online registration centers. If runners just give time to read all the details in the race pages, future race briefings can be shortened to the most essentials during the race day.</p>
								<p> As a timing partner, their staff members are well-trained and the RaceYaya crew itself is always hands-on to make sure that everything goes smoothly. The timings are precise and the results are quickly uploaded to the event websites and shared through social media. Easy to talk-to, Convenient, efficient, and affordable. What more can you ask for from the Race yaya’s?</p>
